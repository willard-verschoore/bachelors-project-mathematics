\begin{abstract}
  In algebraic number theory, the equation \(x + y = 1\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are units in a certain subring of a field, plays an important role in solving various Diophantine equations as well as in matroid theory. The type of subring containing \(x\) and \(y\) is known as a ring of \(S\)-integers, and the equation is called the \(S\)-unit equation. Much work has been done on developing efficient algorithms for solving the S-unit equation in number fields. Implementations of these algorithms are readily available, for example in the computer algebra package SageMath. While an algorithm for solving the S-unit equation in certain function fields is known, no implementation is publicly available.

  We present an implementation of the algorithm for solving the S-unit equation in function fields. We discuss the theory underlying the algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through a number of examples. Notably, our implementation has already proven useful in research in the field of matroid theory.
