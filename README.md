# Bachelor's Project Mathematics

This repository contains the code and thesis written for my bachelor's project on solving the S-unit equation in function fields.

## Running the Code

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) is required to run the code. With SageMath installed, you can run the example file from the project's root directory using
```{bash}
sage code/examples.sage
```
The actual code for solving the S-unit equation is contained in the `code/solver.py` file.
